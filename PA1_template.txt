## Loading and preprocessing the data
  
Load the data (i.e. read.csv()).
  

```r
activity_set <- read.csv('activity.csv')
```

Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis.


```r
activity_set$date <- as.Date(activity_set$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
activity_set$date_time  <- strptime(paste(activity_set$date,  
                                          format(activity_set$interval / 100)),
                                    format="%Y-%m-%d %H.%M")
activity_set$time <- format(activity_set$date_time, format="%H:%M:%S")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day.


```r
total_steps_by_day <- aggregate(activity_set$steps, 
                         by=list(activity_set$date), 
                         FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)
colnames(total_steps_by_day) <- c("date", "steps")
```


```r
hist(total_steps_by_day$steps, main="Daily Steps", xlab="Number of steps")
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4](figure/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png) 

Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.


```r
mean(total_steps_by_day$steps)
```

```
## [1] 9354.23
```

```r
median(total_steps_by_day$steps)
```

```
## [1] 10395
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis).


```r
average_daily_activity <- aggregate(activity_set$steps, 
                                    by=list(activity_set$interval), 
                                    FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)
colnames(average_daily_activity) = c("interval", "steps")
```


```r
plot(average_daily_activity$interval, 
     average_daily_activity$steps, 
     type = "l", xlab="Interval", ylab="Number of steps")
```

![plot of chunk histogram](figure/histogram-1.png) 

Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?



```r
average_daily_activity$interval[which.max
                                (average_daily_activity$interval$steps)]
```

```
## Error in average_daily_activity$interval$steps: $ operator is invalid for atomic vectors
```

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
